### This script places bracket orders based on buy/sell signals from a ticker list.
### It uses an ATR-based method to calculate stop-loss and take-profit levels.

# --- The SDK module (trading_advanced_sdk.py) now handles client initialization.

# --- Trade Sizing Parameters ---
# These parameters determine the dollar value of shares to buy or sell for each trade.
cash_to_buy = 500
cash_to_sell = 500

# --- ATR-Based Risk Management Parameters ---
# SL_MULTIPLIER determines how far the stop-loss is placed, measured in multiples of the ATR.
# For example, 1.0 means the stop-loss will be one ATR value away from the current price.
SL_MULTIPLIER = 0.75

# RISK_REWARD_RATIO defines the target profit relative to the risk.
# For example, a ratio of 1.5 means the take-profit distance from the entry
# will be 1.5 times the stop-loss distance from the entry.
